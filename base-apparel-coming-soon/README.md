## My process

I visualized the page to be composed of three components highlighted with rectangles in the below image. Grid layout seemed to be fit for the desktop design. As for the mobile design, the components are arranged according to the HTML flow.

### What I learned

Scaling SVGs is a difficult task and I've been struggling with it since I began using them. About a month ago, I stumbled upon an [article on css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/scale-svg/#how-to-scale-svg-to-fit-the-available-width-and-adjust-the-height-to-match) when I was researching on this frustrating topic. Although I didn't go through the whole article, I read about a trick called the *padding-bottom* hack. It worked wonderfullyðŸ˜Š. The SVG needs to be rendered as a background image and the below code should be added.

```css
.svg-container{
  height: 0;
  padding: 0; /* reset */
  padding-bottom: calc(100% * 3 / 4);
}
```

Here the percentage width *100%* is multiplied by desired height factor divided by desired width factor according to the article. I don't fully understand how this works but hopefully I will eventually.
